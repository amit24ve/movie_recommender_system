## Introduction

The Movie Recommender System leverages user ratings to recommend movies that are likely to be enjoyed by the user. This is achieved through collaborative filtering, which predicts user preferences based on the preferences of similar users.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations
- Collaborative filtering algorithm
- Easy-to-use interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie_recommender_system.git
    cd movie_recommender_system
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
